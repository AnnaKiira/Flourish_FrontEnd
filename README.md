Flourish is an application designed to function like a subreddit for flower gardeners and enthusiasts. It provides a platform for users to share posts and categorise them within a community focused on cultivating and managing gardens. The app features three main categories for posts:

- Question
- Status
- Guide

With these categories, users can track the progress of their flowers, share gardening tips, and connect with other flower lovers to seek advice on their personal flower planting journeys.
Although I'm not an expert flower gardener, my love for flowers inspired the creation of this app. The idea of a subreddit-like platform where users could categorise their posts around this theme seemed fitting and exciting to me.

My deployed app: https://main--flourishfront.netlify.app/
My backend repo: https://github.com/AnnaKiira/Flourish
My planning materials: https://trello.com/b/lFOblllP/project-4-flower-gardening

Technologies used:
Frontend:
- React
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript

Backend:
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework

Database & tools:
- PostgreSQL
- Postman

Deployment:
- Heroku (Backend)
- Netlify (Frontend)

Key Learnings:
- This was my first time building a backend with Python and Django, after previously using Express. While it felt new and different, the overall structure when coding routes felt similar to my previous projects.
- I really appreciated Django's included admin interface. It was cool to be able to test things very early in the development process.
- After finishing the Django backend and testing in Postman, I faced some struggles with user authentication when starting the React frontend. Compared to my experience with React and Express, Django's security setup was more challenging and less dynamic. I had to quite a bit of debugging and learn to implement CORS and refresh tokens. This project pushed me to learn a lot on my own.
  
Ideas to make Flourish even better:

Add a filter search feature:
- This will allow users to search for specific categories or keywords.
- It will make it much easier to navigate or find posts that users are specifically interested in.

Implement user profile viewing:
- Add functionality that allows users to view other users' profiles.
- This will enable users to see all posts from a specific user, making it easier to follow favorite contributors among the many uploads on the app.
